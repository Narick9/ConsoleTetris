# ConsoleTetris

## What?

Simple, NOT efficient (:D), console tetris written in C# .NET Core and works on Windows, Linux and Mac in the console/terminal.
I do not know how Tetris SHOULD be implemented, but I spent couple of evenings to make this from scratch for fun.

## Why?

Because I can >_<

## How it looks like?

```bash

## How to play?

* Left & Right Arrows - move left & right
* Down Arrow - drop with speed
* Space - Rotate
* E - exit
* R - reset

## Is there end/win?

I wasn't so thoughtful about this prototype. There are no WIN in the end.
